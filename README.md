# Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Restaurant Review Project

## Project Objective

The objective of this project was to take a static design that lacks accesibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader users. A service worker was also added to provide off-line first data to the web app.  

## How to run this app

* Clone the repository

* In the terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
